                    <p>I recognized early on that technology plays an unprecedented role in the world today. Not just as a way to increase productivity, but also a way to engage, encourage and connect with people. I also recognized that this was an industry I wanted to be a part of. I like to think of myself as a jack-of-all-trades in that I’m very hands on from the early conceptual stages of a project through to completion. Aspirations include capitalizing on my passion, personality, skill sets, and valuable experience to further my career in the industry.</p>

                    <p>I started out in San Diego, CA, where I surfed my way through school. After graduating from UC San Diego in 2010, I moved to the Bay Area and began working as a Product Manager at a small software company, where I began to learn the ins and outs of software development, web design and digital marketing. I currently work full-time at Anvato, Inc., a video technology company based in Silicon Valley, where I continue to hone my skills.</p>
